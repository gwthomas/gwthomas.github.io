    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>This is the homepage for Garrett Thomas. It's still under construction. (Sorry!)
        Check back in a while. I'm writing some notes about machine learning and related topics,
        and I'll be putting them up here.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, you can browse <a href="http://www.github.com/gwthomas">my GitHub</a> to see what I'm working on.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science and Statistics.
    My interests include statistical machine learning, education, algorithms, and neuroscience.</p>
