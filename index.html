        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>I am Garrett Thomas, a (soon-to-be) first-year computer science PhD student at Stanford. My academic interests lie broadly in machine learning and related areas, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I also enjoy <a href="notes.html">learning math by writing about it</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Previously I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Berkeley. I was fortunate to be part of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a>'s group, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~avivt/" target="_blank">Aviv Tamar</a> on deep reinforcement learning and its applications to robotics. Our research was largely concerned with policy representation, planning, and generalization.</p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading">Fall 2016, Spring 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2018</h5>
            <p>I was an Undergraduate Student Instructor for <a href="http://www.eecs189.org" target="_blank">CS 189, <i>Introduction to Machine Learning</i></a>. I wrote <a href="docs/math4ml.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Mathematics for Machine Learning</i></a> to help fill gaps in students' mathematical background, particularly in linear algebra, optimization, and probability.</p>
			
			<h5 class="mini-heading">Deep RL Bootcamp</h5>
			<p>I was thrilled to have the opportunity to work as a Teaching Assistant for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures" target="_blank">Deep RL Bootcamp</a>. This two-day introduction to deep reinforcement learning includes a mixture of theory and practice, aiming to expose attendees to a range of topics from the basics to current research frontiers.</p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading">Spring 2016</h5>
            <p>I was an Undergraduate Student Instructor for <a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank">Data 8, <i>Foundations of Data Science</i></a>. This exciting new class teaches modern statistical inference and data analysis with a strong focus on computing.</p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading">Fall 2015</h5>
            <p>I was a Tutor for <a href="http://cs61a.org" target="_blank">CS 61A</a>, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>. This very large and excellent class provides an introduction to computer programming, emphasizing abstractions and giving an overview of several programming paradigms.</p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading">gtml</h5>
            <p>I am developing this <a href="https://github.com/gwthomas/gtml">library</a> to support my own machine learning research. It features tight integration with PyTorch for constructing and optimizing neural networks. These can be trained using supervised or reinforcement learning methods.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading"><i>illume</i></h5>
            <p>A number of years ago (in high school) I developed a light-based puzzle game called <i>illume</i>. It used to be available on the iOS App Store, but I decided it wasn't worth paying for Apple's developer program to continue offering a free app. Prior to its removal it was downloaded over 22,000 times and received many positive reviews from users. A video of the gameplay can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-tSy2u2OA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
