        <div class="section">
            <p>I am Garrett Thomas, a first-year computer science PhD student at Stanford. My academic interests lie broadly in machine learning and related areas, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am currently rotating with <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~yamins/">Dan Yamins</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Previously I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Berkeley. I was fortunate to be part of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>'s group, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~avivt/">Aviv Tamar</a> on deep reinforcement learning and its applications to robotics. Our research was largely concerned with policy structure, planning, and generalization.</p>

            <p>I try to understand mathematical topics better by <a href="notes.html">writing about them</a>.</p>
			
            <h5 class="mini-heading">gtml</h5>
            <p>I am developing this <a href="https://github.com/gwthomas/gtml">library</a> to support my own machine learning research. It features tight integration with PyTorch for constructing and optimizing neural networks. These can be trained using supervised or reinforcement learning methods.</p>

            <h5 class="mini-heading"><i>illume</i></h5>
            <p>A number of years ago (in high school) I developed a light-based puzzle game called <i>illume</i>. It used to be available on the iOS App Store, but I decided it wasn't worth paying for Apple's developer program to continue offering a free app. Prior to its removal it was downloaded over 22,000 times and received many positive reviews from users. A video of the gameplay can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-tSy2u2OA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
